### What is DiceDB?

DiceDB is an open-source, fast, reactive, in-memory database optimized for modern hardware.
Commonly used as a cache, it offers a familiar interface while enabling real-time data
updates through query subscriptions. It delivers higher throughput and lower median latencies,
making it ideal for modern workloads.

We support multiple ways to install DiceDB, one of which is using Docker and the other is building from source.
Both of these methods can be found [here](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/blob/master/README.md).

To work with DiceDB from a command line interface, you can use the [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli)
and the installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/blob/master/README.md).

Once everything is installed, you are all set for a [Hello, World example](/get-started/hello-world/).
