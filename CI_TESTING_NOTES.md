# CI Testing Notes for PR #1

## Problem Identified

The CI workflows created in PR #1 were configured to trigger on the `master` branch, but this repository uses `main` as its default branch. This meant that the workflows would never trigger automatically.

## Solution

Updated the following workflow files to use `main` instead of `master`:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- `.github/workflows/linter.yml`

## Changes Made

### test.yml
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]  # Changed from [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]  # Changed from [master]
```

### linter.yml
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]  # Changed from [master]
    paths:
      - '**/*.go'
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]  # Changed from [master]
    paths:
      - '**/*.go'
```

## Verification

1. **Local Build**: ✅ `make build` completes successfully
2. **Local Unit Tests**: ⚠️ Partial success - 6 out of 7 packages pass
   - Passing: internal/auth, internal/dencoding, internal/regex, internal/server/utils, internal/store, internal/id
   - Known failure: internal/eval (documented in TESTING_TODO.md from PR #1)

3. **Workflow Triggering**: ✅ Test workflow now triggers on PRs to main
   - Status shows "action_required" which is expected for PRs that modify workflow files (GitHub security feature)
   - Once approved, workflows will run as designed

4. **Linter Workflow**: ✅ Correctly configured (doesn't trigger since no .go files changed in this PR)

## Expected Behavior After Approval

When the workflows are approved and run:
- **Build job**: Should pass (verified locally)
- **Unit test job**: Will show known failures in internal/eval package (expected and documented)

## Next Steps

1. Repository owner should approve workflow runs for this PR
2. Monitor the actual CI execution to confirm it works as expected
3. Address internal/eval test issues in a follow-up PR (requires functional expertise as noted in PR #1)
